A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid.

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.

Input Format
The first line of input contains two integers m and n seprated by space.
The next m line of input contains n space seprated integers denoting the obstacleGrid.

Output Format
The only line of output contains an integer denoting the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

Explanation

There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

import java.util.*;

class Solution{
    public static int UniquePaths2(int m,int n,int[][] obstacleGrid){
        //write code here
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[][] obstacleGrid = new int[m][n];
        for(int i=0;i<m;++i){
            for(int j=0;j<n;++j){
                obstacleGrid[i][j]=sc.nextInt();
            }
        }
        Solution obj = new Solution();
        int ans = obj.UniquePaths2(m,n,obstacleGrid);
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
