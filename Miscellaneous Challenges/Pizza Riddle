Robert works as a chef at a pizza place. He has only three kinds of pizza bases:- big, medium, and small.

There are a fixed number of bases for each size.

Design a pizza base management system for his kitchen.

Implement the PizzaBase class:

`PizzaBase(int big, int medium, int small)` Initializes object of the PizzaBase class. The number of bases for each pizza size are given as part of the constructor.
`bool checkBase(int pizzaSize)` Checks whether there is a pizza base available of pizzaSize for the pizza ordered. pizzaSize can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. If there is no base available, return false, else make a pizza from a base of that size and return true.
Input Format
The first line contains q which denotes the total number of operations to be performed.

Each query contains a single integer that denotes the size of the required pizza base.

Output Format
Return the result for every query of the type checkBase.

Explanation

Initially 2 Big, 1 Medium, 1 small bases are available.

First query:- a small base is needed. Since number of small bases > 0, return true.

Counter-> 2 Big, 1 Medium, 0 small.

Second query:- a small base is needed. Since number of small bases = 0, return false.

Counter-> 2 Big, 1 Medium, 0 small.

Third query:- a medium base is needed. Since number of medium bases > 0, return true.

Counter-> 2 Big, 0 Medium, 0 small.

Fourth query:- a medium base is needed. Since number of medium bases = 0, return false.

Counter-> 2 Big, 0 Medium, 0 small.

Fifth query:- a small base is needed. Since number of small bases = 0, return false.

Counter-> 2 Big, 0 Medium, 0 small.
