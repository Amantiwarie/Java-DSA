Ramesh is given two arrays, arr1 and arr2. He wants to sort arr1 in such a way that the relative order of arr2 is maintained in arr1. For elements that are not present in arr2, he wants to add the these elements at the end of the array in sorted fashion.

Can you help Ramesh achieve this task?

Input Format
First line contains two integers n and m denoting size of arrays arr1 and arr2 respectively.

Second line contains n space separated integers denoting the array arr1.

Third line contains m space separated integers denoting the array arr2.

Output Format
Print the relatively sorted arr1

Example 1
Input

11 4
2 1 2 5 7 1 9 3 6 8 8
2 1 8 3
Output

2 2 1 1 8 8 3 5 6 7 9
Explanation

arr1 is sorted according to arr2 elements, hence 2 comes before 1, 1 before 8 and 8 before 3. Elements not in arr2 are sorted and appended at the end of arr1.

  static void relativeSorting(int arr1[], int n, int arr2[], int m) {

    // Step 1: frequency map
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> freq = new TreeMap<>();

    for (int x : arr1) {
        freq.put(x, freq.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1);
    }

    // Step 2: print elements according to arr2
    for (int x : arr2) {
        if (freq.containsKey(x)) {
            int count = freq.get(x);
            while (count-- > 0) {
                System.out.print(x + " ");
            }
            freq.remove(x); // remove printed elements
        }
    }

    // Step 3: print remaining sorted elements
    for (int key : freq.keySet()) {
        int count = freq.get(key);
        while (count-- > 0) {
            System.out.print(key + " ");
        }
    }
}
